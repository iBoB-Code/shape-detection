The project was built using OpenCV2.413 x64 & VisualStudio 2017

In order to ensure that the correct version of OpenCV is used with the project, we have bundled the OpenCV prebuilt libraries and added a few batch files to make things easier to execute.  

1) To launch the VS project, please execute the "launchSolution.bat" file.
2) To launch the built executable against all the images, please execute the "launchSolution.bat" file or edit its contents as needed before launch.
